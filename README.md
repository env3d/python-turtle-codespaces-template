# python-turtle-codespaces-template

A redefinition of the python turtle module to allow for screen recorded output instead
of output to display.

Ideal for turtle coding exercises to be used in github codespaces (or anywhere
lacking a display, i.e. headless mode).

In this example, all code is written in main.py

Execute the program by entering the following in the terminal
```
python main.py 
```
